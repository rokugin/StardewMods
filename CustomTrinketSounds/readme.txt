This mod doesn't replace any of the vanilla sounds on its own.
It changes the audio cue names for several of the trinket and companion sounds.

New audio cue names:

parrotCompanion			replaces the parrot squawk sound for the parrot egg companion
iceball					replaces the fireball sound for the ice rod
frogCompanion			replaces the croak sound for the frog egg companion
tongueHit				replaces the fish slap sound for the frog egg companion

Unchanged audio cue names:

fairy_heal				plays when the fairy heals you
frog_slap				plays when the frog companion hops
magic_arrow_hit			plays when magic arrow projectile hits
magic_arrow				plays when magic arrow fires projectile
